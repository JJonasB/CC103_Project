Currently this project is in-progress.
A lot of features are hard to implement and the code is a mess but it works.

A lot of searching and trial and error within. And some features are working yet there's some things I still do not understand.
Note that all of the functionality is being handled by 1 person and the javafx interface was created by only 2 people.
The more progress that this project do, the more that I need to review how and why this works.

As I write this it's 4/28/2025 12:51 AM, currently most of the features are still missing and needs fixing, like the homepage should not have some features when they're students.
Anyways this became a log but since it's private, it's fine for now. I have a headache from doing this for too long.
